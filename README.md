# **Sentiment Analysis from Scratch** (Ongoing)

This project classifies movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as **positive** or **negative**, with a focus on building sentiment analysis models from the ground up using basic tools like **numpy**. Every stage of the NLP pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, is manually implemented to provide a deep understanding of AI model construction.

## **Key Features and Project Progress:** 
- **Manual Data Loading**: Custom parsing of IMDb movie reviews. ✅
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and text cleaning. ✅
- **Feature Extraction**: Implemented both **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF** from scratch. ✅
- **Custom Models**: Built a **Naive Bayes classifier** and a basic **neural network** using only numpy.
- **Numerical Computation**: Leveraged numpy for matrix operations and computations.
