### Sentiment Analysis from Scratch

The goal of this project is to detect the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. This project focuses on AI model building in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), where each component of the sentiment analysis pipeline is manually implemented. It includes data loading, text preprocessing, feature extraction, and custom classifiers. Techniques such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Naive Bayes are built from scratch using only numpy, along with a simple neural network. This approach highlights a deep understanding of how AI models are created and trained on text data.
